Welcome to the Pathfinding-visualizer GitHub repository! 
This react application allows you visualize different pathfinding and maze-generation algorithms

# Features: #
* A resizable grid that you can draw custom mazes on:
  * Mouse left click to add a wall
  * Mouse right clcick to remove a node
* Ability to hover and drag start and end nodes anywhere on grid
* A speed slider that changes the visualization speed of the algorithms
* A variety of pathfinding algorithms:
  * Depth-First Search
  * Breadth-First Search
  * A* Search
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
  * Greedy Best-First Search
* A variety of maze generation algorithms:
  * Depth-First Search algorithm
  * Recursive Division
  * Prim's algorithm
